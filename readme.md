# Programming Language Trend Analysis - Matplotlib Data Visualization

This project focuses on analyzing programming language trends and visualizing the data using Matplotlib, a powerful Python library for data visualization. By utilizing Matplotlib and Pandas, we can gain insights into programming language popularity, growth, and other relevant metrics.

## Features

- Learn how to visualize programming language trends using Matplotlib
- Manipulate and transform data with Pandas to achieve the desired format
- Work with timestamps and time-series data for analyzing trends over time
- Customize and style line charts to create visually appealing visualizations

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/shahiddhariwala/programming_language_trend_analysis_matplot_data_visualization
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies, including Matplotlib and Pandas:
   ```
   pip install matplotlib pandas
   ```

3. Explore the project files and examples provided in the repository to understand how to visualize programming language trends, manipulate data with Pandas, work with timestamps, and customize line charts.

## Usage

The project contains various Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate different aspects of programming language trend analysis and data visualization. Each script focuses on a specific topic or technique, providing explanations and code examples.

You can run the scripts individually to see the output and gain insights into programming language trends. Modify the code and experiment with different datasets to explore further.
